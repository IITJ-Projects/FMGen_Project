\section{Introduction}

Conversational AI systems have evolved significantly, with modern implementations requiring real-time response generation, context awareness, and scalable architectures. This paper presents Zevo AI, a production-grade conversational AI platform that implements a text-based interaction mode with advanced features including real-time token streaming, retrieval-augmented generation, and adaptive response generation.

The text mode implementation addresses key challenges in conversational AI: providing immediate user feedback through streaming responses, maintaining conversation context, and integrating external knowledge bases through RAG. The system architecture follows a microservices pattern, enabling independent scaling and deployment of components.

The contributions of this work include: (1) a production-ready text mode implementation with real-time streaming capabilities, (2) integration of RAG for context-aware responses, (3) a modular service architecture supporting independent scaling, and (4) performance optimizations achieving sub-5 second end-to-end response times.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Overview}

Zevo AI employs a microservices architecture with five core services: Orchestration Service, RAG Service, LLM Service, TTS Service, and ASR Service. The text mode implementation primarily utilizes the Orchestration, RAG, and LLM services, with optional TTS for on-demand audio playback.

The system follows a pipeline architecture where user text input flows through: Frontend $\rightarrow$ Orchestration Service $\rightarrow$ RAG Service $\rightarrow$ LLM Service $\rightarrow$ Frontend, with optional TTS synthesis when requested by the user.

\subsection{Service Components}

\subsubsection{Orchestration Service}
The Orchestration Service (Port 8000) acts as the central coordinator, managing session state, conversation history, and pipeline coordination. It implements WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication, enabling token-by-token streaming from the LLM service to the frontend.

\subsubsection{RAG Service}
The RAG Service (Port 8004) implements retrieval-augmented generation using dual embedding models: BGE-Large-EN-v1.5 for English text and multilingual-E5-Large for multilingual content. The service integrates with Qdrant vector database for efficient similarity search and employs BGE-Reranker-Large for relevance scoring.

\subsubsection{LLM Service}
The LLM Service (Port 8002) hosts Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using vLLM inference engine. The service implements AsyncLLMEngine for true token-by-token streaming, enabling real-time response generation with sub-100ms token latency.

\subsubsection{TTS Service}
The TTS Service (Port 8003) provides on-demand text-to-speech synthesis using MeloTTS. In text mode, TTS is not automatically triggered; instead, users can request audio playback via a speaker icon, which calls the \texttt{/api/tts} endpoint.

\subsection{Frontend Implementation}

The frontend application (Port 8080) implements a single-page web interface with WebSocket support for real-time communication. The text mode interface includes: text input area, chat history display, real-time streaming text rendering with Markdown support, and optional speaker icon for manual TTS playback.

\section{Text Mode Implementation}

\subsection{Real-Time Streaming Architecture}

The text mode implementation features real-time token streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol. When a user submits a text message, the frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the Orchestration Service, which then streams tokens from the LLM Service as they are generated.

The streaming pipeline operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User submits text message via frontend
\item Orchestration Service receives message and initiates RAG context retrieval
\item LLM Service generates response tokens using AsyncLLMEngine
\item Tokens are streamed to Orchestration Service via SSE
\item Orchestration Service forwards tokens to frontend via WebSocket
\item Frontend renders tokens incrementally, providing real-time feedback
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{RAG Integration}

The RAG integration prioritizes knowledge base information over general LLM knowledge. When a user query is received, the Orchestration Service calls the RAG Service to retrieve relevant documents. The retrieved context is prepended to the LLM prompt with explicit instructions to prioritize this information.

The RAG retrieval process includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Query embedding generation using appropriate model (BGE for English, multilingual-E5 for others)
\item Vector similarity search in Qdrant database
\item Reranking using BGE-Reranker-Large for relevance scoring
\item Top-K document selection (default K=5)
\item Context formatting with priority instructions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptive Response Generation}

The system implements adaptive response length based on user intent. A heuristic function analyzes the user's message for keywords indicating preference for detailed or concise responses. Keywords such as ``explain in detail'', ``step-by-step'', or ``comprehensive'' trigger extended responses (up to 2048 tokens), while brief queries receive concise responses (96-240 tokens).

\subsection{Conversation Context Management}

The Orchestration Service maintains in-memory conversation history for each session. The last four messages (two exchanges) are included in the LLM context to maintain conversational continuity. The context structure prioritizes: (1) RAG-retrieved knowledge base information, (2) system instructions, and (3) recent conversation history.

\section{Data Flow and Processing}

\subsection{Request Processing Pipeline}

The text mode request processing follows a sequential pipeline with the following stages:

\textbf{Stage 1: Input Reception} - The frontend receives user text input and sends it to the Orchestration Service via WebSocket or HTTP POST to \texttt{/api/chat}.

\textbf{Stage 2: Context Retrieval} - The Orchestration Service calls the RAG Service with the user query. The RAG Service generates embeddings, searches Qdrant, and returns relevant documents with similarity scores.

\textbf{Stage 3: Prompt Construction} - The Orchestration Service constructs the LLM prompt by combining: RAG context (with priority instructions), system context, and recent conversation history.

\textbf{Stage 4: Response Generation} - The LLM Service processes the prompt using AsyncLLMEngine, generating tokens incrementally. Tokens are streamed back to the Orchestration Service via SSE.

\textbf{Stage 5: Response Delivery} - The Orchestration Service forwards tokens to the frontend via WebSocket, enabling real-time rendering.

\subsection{WebSocket Communication Protocol}

The WebSocket protocol (\texttt{ws://agent.zevo360.in/ws/chat/\{session\_id\}}) supports bidirectional communication with the following message types:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{text\_message}: User text input with session identifier
\item \texttt{llm\_token}: Incremental token from LLM with full response preview
\item \texttt{complete}: Final response with latency report
\item \texttt{error}: Error messages for failed requests
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTP REST API}

For non-streaming requests, the system provides HTTP REST endpoints:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{POST /api/chat}: Text chat with conversation history
\item \texttt{POST /api/tts}: On-demand TTS synthesis
\item \texttt{GET /health}: Service health check
\item \texttt{GET /api/performance}: Performance statistics
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Evaluation}

\subsection{Latency Metrics}

The system tracks latency at each pipeline stage. Typical performance metrics for text mode include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Connection initialization: 360 ms
\item RAG retrieval: 200 ms
\item LLM first token (Time-to-First-Token): 2000 ms
\item LLM token streaming: Real-time (50+ tokens/second)
\item Total end-to-end response: 4600 ms (for complete response)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Throughput Capabilities}

The system demonstrates the following throughput characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item LLM generation: 50+ tokens/second using vLLM AsyncLLMEngine
\item RAG queries: 1000+ queries/second using Qdrant vector search
\item WebSocket messages: 1000+ messages/second for real-time communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resource Utilization}

The production deployment utilizes:
\begin{itemize}
\item GPU Memory: 8 GB (LLM service with AWQ quantization)
\item CPU: 40\% average utilization across services
\item RAM: 16 GB total across all services
\item Network: 1 MB/s average for streaming communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization Techniques}

Several optimizations contribute to the system's performance:

\textbf{Model Quantization}: The LLM service uses AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) 4-bit quantization, reducing GPU memory requirements from 16 GB to 4 GB while maintaining response quality.

\textbf{Streaming Optimizations}: The AsyncLLMEngine implementation enables true token-by-token streaming without buffering, providing immediate user feedback.

\textbf{Health Check Caching}: Service health checks are cached for 60 seconds, reducing overhead from frequent monitoring requests.

\textbf{Context Truncation}: Recent conversation history is limited to the last four messages, reducing prompt size and improving processing speed.

\section{Deployment Architecture}

\subsection{Docker Containerization}

All services are containerized using Docker, enabling consistent deployment across environments. The \texttt{docker-compose.yml} configuration defines seven services with appropriate resource limits, health checks, and network isolation.

\subsection{Service Dependencies}

The orchestration service depends on: ASR Service, LLM Service, RAG Service, and TTS Service. The RAG Service depends on Qdrant database. Services communicate via Docker network (\texttt{zevo-network}) using service names for DNS resolution.

\subsection{Scaling Considerations}

The microservices architecture enables independent scaling. The LLM Service can be scaled horizontally (with model replication) or vertically (with larger GPU memory). The RAG Service can scale independently based on query load, and Qdrant supports horizontal scaling through clustering.

\section{Key Features and Capabilities}

\subsection{Real-Time Streaming}

The text mode implementation provides ChatGPT-like real-time streaming experience, with tokens appearing incrementally as they are generated. This eliminates the perception of delay and provides immediate user feedback.

\subsection{Context-Aware Responses}

RAG integration enables the system to provide responses based on ingested knowledge bases, prioritizing retrieved information over general LLM knowledge. This ensures accurate, domain-specific responses.

\subsection{Adaptive Response Length}

The system automatically adjusts response length based on user intent, providing concise answers for simple queries and detailed explanations when requested.

\subsection{Markdown Rendering}

The frontend supports Markdown rendering for formatted responses, including headings, lists, tables, and code blocks, enhancing readability of technical content.

\subsection{Manual TTS Playback}

While text mode does not automatically generate audio, users can request TTS playback via a speaker icon, which calls the \texttt{/api/tts} endpoint for on-demand audio synthesis.

\section{Challenges and Solutions}

\subsection{Streaming Latency}

Initial implementation experienced buffering delays in token streaming. This was resolved by: (1) using AsyncLLMEngine instead of synchronous LLM generation, (2) implementing immediate token forwarding without buffering, and (3) using HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/2 to avoid protocol-level buffering.

\subsection{RAG Context Integration}

Ensuring RAG context takes priority over general knowledge required explicit prompt engineering. The solution includes: (1) prepending RAG context with priority instructions, (2) separating RAG context from system context, and (3) using clear delimiters in the prompt structure.

\subsection{Session Management}

In-memory session storage limits scalability. The current implementation uses in-memory dictionaries, with plans for Redis integration for production scalability.

\section{Conclusion}
